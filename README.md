# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# LAB | Hello React

## Introduction

We just learned the basics of React and JSX. We saw how to create a new React app using the Create React App package. In this exercise we will practice what we just learned by creating a simple landing page (hopefully with some styles :blossom:).

<!--  ![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_3e87cc1f09c32a09911a65d94c1bd4f0.png) -->

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create a Pull Request so that your TAs can check your work.

## Instructions

### Iteration 1 | Create React app

Let's get this party started! First, you will need to create a new React app.

Navigate to the root folder of the LAB. When you're in the root folder, use the Create React App (CRA) package to create a new React project. 

Once you have created the app, navigate to the root folder of the app. From here, run the app in the development mode and open it in the browser.



You can reference the CRA Documentation and the Getting Started page here: [Create React App - Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

### Iteration 2 | Prepare the app

Now that you have created the app let's clean up the `App.js` a bit. Remove the initial content generated by the CRA to get the following structure:

```jsx
// src/App.js
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App"></div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

<br>

### Iteration 3 | Download the assets

To create the landing page we will need few images. Inside of the `src/` folder create a new folder named `images`. The folder should be nested in the following way `src/images/`. 

Next, download the following images and save them in the `src/images/` folder:

### Iteration 4 | Landing Page

Finally, let's create our landing page. Using the assets that you downloaded in the previous iteration recreate the following landing page:

For now, don't worry about creating more than one component, we will cover that in the following lessons!

Happy coding! :heart:
